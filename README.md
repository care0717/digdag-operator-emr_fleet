# Concept

* Configuable for complicated EMR Cluster
* Available for credentials on servers if server administrators allow the operation
* Small processing that a operator has

# Configuration

## Remarks

- An EMR Cluster is also called an job flow. In the below explanations, I use both terms.
- type `DurationParam` is strings matched `\s*(?:(?<days>\d+)\s*d)?\s*(?:(?<hours>\d+)\s*h)?\s*(?:(?<minutes>\d+)\s*m)?\s*(?:(?<seconds>\d+)\s*s)?\s*`.

- **tags**: A list of tags to associate with a cluster and propagate to Amazon EC2 instances. (string to string map, optional)
- **release_label**: The Amazon EMR release label, which determines the version of open-source application packages installed on the cluster. Release labels are in the form emr-x.x.x, where x.x.x is an Amazon EMR release version. For more information about Amazon EMR release versions and included application versions and features, see [Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/).
